# SmartCpp

**SmartCpp** is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps you analyze C++ code, understand compiler errors, and fix them with ease.

It guides developers through:
- 📌 Clear explanations of errors  
- 🧭 Step-by-step fixes  
- 🛠️ Corrected versions of the code  

SmartCpp also features an **inbuilt compiler** that runs your code automatically. The goal is to streamline the debugging process so developers can focus on writing correct, clean, and understandable code—faster.
